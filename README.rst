Here's a basic example showing how one might grab the name of all repos:

    >>> from anvil import Anvil
    >>> anvil = Anvil("https://kiln.yourcompany.com/kiln", False)
    >>> anvil.create_session_by_prompting()
    Kiln Username: me@mycomponay.com
    Password: ***********
    >>> repos = anvil.get_repos()
    >>> print '\n'.join(r.name for r in repos)
    RepoA
    RepoB
    RepoC
